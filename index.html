								<p>My name is Gretchen and I have been teaching and tutoring for the last 10 years! I graduated with a degree in Cell and Developmental Biology at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in 2017. After graduation, I moved to Santiago, Chile where I worked as a translator and developed advanced Spanish language skills. I am currently living in Seattle, Washington, where I offer both in-person and virtual Science and Spanish classes to children, college students, and adults. In my free time, I love to travel, ski, play intramural sports, garden, and cook!</p>
								<p>At UCSB I taught Biology to undergraduates in both a class setting and one-on-one. I also worked as a substitute teacher for the Davis Joint Unified School District, so I have experience teaching/tutoring elementary school students up to high school (K-12). Over the past years, I have taught a variety of science classes including AP Biology, college-level Biology, Chemistry, Genetics, and Biotechnology. </p>
								<p>During my time in Chile, I was an English language teacher where I worked with business professionals to improve language proficiency. Upon my return to the States, I started a job at a tutoring company and taught Spanish course material to high school students. I have experience teaching Spanish to both children and adults, so if you’re an adult looking to improve your conversational Spanish, don’t hesitate to sign up! I can help with anything from improving Spanish fluency to preparing for exams. It’s all up to you or your child’s goals!</p>
								<p>Please check out the different tutoring options I offer and send me a message with any questions you may have. I am also happy to chat over the phone to see if we or your child will be a good fit for my classes. Best of luck studying!</p>

								<h4>School is back in session and it’s time to start the year off right! </h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/g_science.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>As we all know, science courses tend to be one of the more tricky subjects for students of all ages. These subjects include a vast amount of material, a great deal of memorization, and analytical thinking. It’s no wonder it tends to be so hard for students! Despite its challenging nature, science is still an integral part of learning and understanding our everyday life.</p>
								<p>I am here to make this learning process a whole lot easier! With 10 years of experience teaching various science courses, I can aid students in understanding course material, preparing for exams, and developing methods for independent problem solving. The tools provided in my classes will result in increased academic performance in the course and future science classes. I have tutored a range of different science and laboratory courses to all age groups, including college level.</p>
